Identify the overall problem pattern:

This problem involves checking for duplicate values in an array of integers. We can use various approaches, but one common way is to use a data structure to keep track of the values we have seen so far.

Discuss possible strategies:

One approach is to use a Set data structure. We can iterate through the array, adding each element to the Set. If we encounter an element that is already in the Set, we know there is a duplicate, and we return true. If we finish iterating through the array without finding any duplicates, we return false.

Select and sketch out an algorithm:

Initialize an empty Set to keep track of seen values.
Iterate through the array nums.
For each element num in nums:
    If num is already in the Set, return true (duplicate found).
    Otherwise, add num to the Set.
After the loop, return false (no duplicates found).

Prepare one or more test cases from the original examples:

Test Case 1: Input: [1,2,3,1] => Expected Output: true
Test Case 2: Input: [1,2,3,4] => Expected Output: false
Test Case 3: Input: [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2] => Expected Output: true
