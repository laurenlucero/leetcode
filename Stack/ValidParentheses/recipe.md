1. Reflect back the problem statement to the interviewer:

We're given a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces. We need to determine if the input string is valid based on the following conditions:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
Verify with at least one example of input â†’ output:

- Example 1: Input: "()" => Output: true
- Example 2: Input: "()[]{}" => Output: true
- Example 3: Input: "(]" => Output: false

2. Identify the overall problem pattern:

This problem involves checking the validity of a string based on the arrangement of brackets. We need to ensure that for every open bracket, there is a corresponding close bracket, and they are in the correct order.

3. Discuss possible strategies:

One approach to solve this problem is to use a stack data structure. We can iterate through the string and push open brackets onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if it matches the bracket at the top of the stack. If it does, we pop the bracket from the stack; otherwise, the string is not valid.

4. Select and sketch out an algorithm in pseudocode:

- Initialize an empty stack.
- Iterate through each character in the input string.
- If the character is an open bracket ('(', '[', or '{'), push it onto the stack.
- If the character is a closing bracket (')', ']', or '}'):
    - If the stack is empty, return false (no matching open bracket).
    - Pop the top element from the stack and compare it to the current closing bracket.
    - If they don't match, return false.
- After the loop, if the stack is empty, return true; otherwise, return false.
