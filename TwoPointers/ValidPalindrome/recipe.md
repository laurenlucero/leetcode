Reflect back the problem statement to the interviewer:

We're given a string s, and we need to determine if it is a palindrome. To be considered a palindrome:

- We should ignore the case (convert all letters to lowercase).
- We should remove all non-alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers).
- The resulting string should read the same forward and backward.

Verify with at least one example of input â†’ output:

Example 1: Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" => Output: true
Example 2: Input: "race a car" => Output: false
Example 3: Input: " " => Output: true

Identify the overall problem pattern:

This problem involves string manipulation and comparison to check if a string is a palindrome.

Discuss possible strategies:

We can remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert the string to lowercase to get the cleaned version of the string.
Then, we can compare the cleaned string with its reverse to check if it's a palindrome.

Select and sketch out an algorithm in pseudocode:

Clean the string s by:

- Converting it to lowercase.
- Removing all non-alphanumeric characters.
- Compare the cleaned string with its reverse.
- If they are the same, return true; otherwise, return false.

Prepare one or more test cases from the original examples:

Test Case 1: Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" => Expected Output: true
Test Case 2: Input: "race a car" => Expected Output: false
Test Case 3: Input: " " => Expected Output: true
